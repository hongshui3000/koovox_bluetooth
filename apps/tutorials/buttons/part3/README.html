    <h1>Buttons Tutorial: Part 3 - Button Handlers 2</h1>
    <h4>Holding a button, holding and then releasing a button, and repeated messages whilst holding down a button</h4>
    <hr>
    
    <h2><a name="about">About Part 3</a></h2>
    <p>
      Part 3 of this tutorial adds three common button use cases compared to
      part 2. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple button use cases described here are holding down a button,
      holding down and then releasing a button, and repeated messages being issued whilst a 
      button is pressed.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="code">The Code</a></h2>
    <p>
      Code fragments from Parts 1 and 2 can be re-used but to maintain the simplicity 
of the code, old messages are replaced with the new ones.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="button"><code>part3_buttons.button</code></a></h3>
    <p>
      The button functionality is defined in the <code>part3_buttons.button</code>
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the button file is exactly same as in part 2, except that the messages
      are different. Handling buttons really is that simple using the SDK
      button interface as every single button event is... an event!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>held</code> message is sent when the button has been pressed down
      for the duration given as a parameter. All timeout are in
      milliseconds, i.e. 2000 means 2 seconds and 500 means half a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the buttons defined in parts 1 and 2, this tutorial requires two buttons
      to be held down instead of one. That is simply done by using two PIO names
      instead of one.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 44: 
 47: // Send message AB_HELD when BUTTON_A and BUTTON_B are pressed for a second
 48: message AB_HELD
 49:     BUTTON_A BUTTON_B   held 1000
 50: </pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      The <code>held_release</code> message is sent when the button is released
      after being pressed down for the duration given as a parameter.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 48: 
 51: // Send message A_HELD_RELEASE when BUTTON_A is released after being pressed
 52: // for at least 3 seconds.
 53: // Note: a sent 'held' message cancels any further 'held_release' messages.
 54: message A_HELD_RELEASE
 55:     BUTTON_A    held_release 3000
 56: </pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      The <code>repeat</code> keyword is used to repeat the message periodically as long 
as the original message conditions are met. The time between individual messages are given as a parameter.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 54: 
 57: // Send message B_HELD when BUTTON_B has been pressed for a second
 58: // Repeat the message every second button is still held
 59: message B_HELD
 60:     BUTTON_B    held 1000
 61:     BUTTON_B    repeat 1000
 62: </pre></td></tr></table>

    <h3><a name="main"><code>main.c</code></a></h3>
    <p>
      The only changes that are required in the main application are for the handling
of the the new messages.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="test">Testing the Application</a></h2>
    <p>
      This application only reacts to changes on PIO 0 (Button A) and PIO 1
      (Button B). A message is sent when either
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both buttons A and B has been pressed down for a second,</li>
      <li>Button A has been pressed at least 3 seconds and is then released,
        or </li>
      <li>Button B has been pressed down for a second, or kept pressed down
        for a second since the last message.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As button messages are automatically handled based on very simple
      criteria, there may be situations where more complex uses cases must be
      handled. That does not mean that everything must be handled manually, as
      in part 1, but only the complex buttons are handled separately. This
      approach is described in part 4 of the tutorial (<code>buttons/part4.xiw</code>).
