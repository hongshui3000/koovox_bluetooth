    <h2><a name="About This Tutorial">About this Tutorial</a></h2>
    <p>
      This tutorial demonstrates the use of PIO lines as an input signal in several small and progressive steps. 
      This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of the C language and have read and understood <b>Writing
 BlueCore Applications User Guide</b> (CS-110344-UG).
    </p>

    <p>
      This tutorial is divided into four parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Basic PIO messages</li>
      <li>Button handlers 1: Pressing a button, releasing a button, and double-clicking a button</li>
      <li>Button handlers 2: Holding a button, holding and then releasing a button, and repeated messages whilst holding down a button</li>
      <li>Button handlers 3: Advanced button handling and further tasks</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Each part is wrapped in a separate xIDE workspace (<code>part<i>n</i>.xiw</code>)
 and contains the source code and ReadMe for a simple (in structure and functionality) and working 
example application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To start this tutorial, open <code>part1</code> workspace
 (<code>tutorials/buttons/part1.xiw</code>) in xIDE.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="AdditionalNotes">Additional Notes</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>This top-level workspace and project is intentionally empty.</li>
      <li>The tutorials contain code fragments from the provided source code files.</li>
      <li>A source code line prefixed by the '+' symbol means that it is a required code change, 
      whereas a source code line prefixed with the '-' symbol means that the code should be removed.</li>
    </ol>
