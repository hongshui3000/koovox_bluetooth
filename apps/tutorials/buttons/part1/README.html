    <h1>Buttons Tutorial: Part 1 - Basic PIO messages</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <h2><a name="about">About Part 1</a></h2>
    <p>
     
      Part 1 of this tutorial describes a very simple application that defines
      a state for the single task and sets this task to receive a message when
      the PIO lines change their status i.e. a button is depressed.
      <br>
      The source code provided will work without any further changes.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="code">The Code</a></h2>
    <p>
      The tutorial has been designed to encourage you to write your own 
application based on the fundamental mechanisms being demonstrated here.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="main"><code>main.c</code></a></h3>
    <p>
      File <code>main.c</code> contains an example application that
      logs information on the button press events in xIDE's <b>Print
 Channel 0</b> tab. The example is designed to be as simple as possible and
 annotated where helpful.  You will find increased annotation where the source
 code becomes more complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In BlueCore, every PIO has a corresponding bit in a bit mask; bit 0 refers to PIO0, 
 bit 1 refers to PIO1 etc. This tutorial will end up using four PIO
      lines which are named <b>BUTTON_A</b>, <b>BUTTON_B</b>, <b>BUTTON_C</b> and <b>BUTTON_D</b>.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 11: 
 12: #define BUTTON_A        (1 &lt;&lt; 0)        /* PIO0 is BUTTON_A */
 13: #define BUTTON_B        (1 &lt;&lt; 1)        /* PIO1 is BUTTON_B */
 14: #define BUTTON_C        (1 &lt;&lt; 2)        /* PIO2 is BUTTON_C */
 15: #define BUTTON_D        (1 &lt;&lt; 3)        /* PIO3 is BUTTON_D */
 16: </pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      To receive status change information on PIOs, the application needs to
      register a task to receive the PIO messages. This task is registered using
      the <code>MessagePioTask</code> command, line 34, and the PIO lines
      which the task is interested in is declared using the <code>PioDebounce</code> command, lines 37 and 38.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 32: 
 33:     /* Set app task to receive PIO messages */
 34:     MessagePioTask(&app.task);
 35: 
 36:     /* Setup PIO interrupt messages */
 37:     PioDebounce32(BUTTON_A | BUTTON_B,  /* PIO pins we are interested in */
 38:                 2, 20);                 /* 2 reads and 20ms between them */
 39: </pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      As described in the <b>Writing BlueCore Applications User Guide</b>, every task
      needs a message handler in order to function correctly. In this first part of the tutorial, there is
      only one message to handle, <code>MESSAGE_PIO_CHANGED</code>, line 49,
      and to make the code easier to understand the message is actually handled in 
      its own function <code>handle_pio()</code>, line 58.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 45: static void app_handler(Task task, MessageId id, Message message) 
 46: {
 47:     switch (id)
 48:     {
 49:     case MESSAGE_PIO_CHANGED:
 50:         handle_pio(task, (MessagePioChanged*)message);
 51:         break;
 52:         
 53:     default:
 54:         printf("Unhandled message 0x%x\n", id);
 55:     }
 56: }</pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      Each time the underlying firmware determines a debounced PIO change, it sends a
      message containing the information about the current PIO status. It is up to
      application to handle this information, and Part 1 simply prints if the button has been been 
pressed (i.e. PIO line goes high). As previously described, the PIO line status is a bit mask of lines 
reflecting the voltage status of each of the PIOs. Hence the applications needs to systematically check which bit (or bits) is set.
 Lines 60 and 61 compare the current PIO line status of buttons defined earlier.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 58: static void handle_pio(Task task, MessagePioChanged *pio)
 59: {
 60:     if (pio-&gt;state & BUTTON_A) printf("Button A pressed\n");
 61:     if (pio-&gt;state & BUTTON_B) printf("Button B pressed\n");    
 62: }</pre></td></tr></table>

    <h2><a name="test">Testing the Application</a></h2>
    <p>
      This application only reacts to changes on PIO 0 (Button A) and PIO 1
      (Button B). If either of these buttons are pressed,
      <code>handle_pio()</code> will check the PIO state and print the button status information.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if Button A is pressed (and not released), and then button B is pressed, the
      application output is actually <pre>Button A pressed
Button A pressed
Button B pressed</pre> as the printout is based on current PIO status. In most
      cases that is not important, but the information about which button is
      pressed or released is. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be easily handled using the SDK button
      interface as described in part 2 of the tutorial (<code>tutorials/buttons/part2.xiw</code>).
