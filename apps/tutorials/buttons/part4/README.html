    <h1>Buttons Tutorial: Part 4 - Button handlers 3</h1>
    <h4>Advanced button handling and further tasks</h4>
    <hr>
    
    <h2><a name="about">About Part 4</a></h2>
    <p>
      Part 4 of this tutorial introduces the way of having simple buttons and
      complex PIO handling at the same time, and gives ideas for further tasks
      that can be done using PIO lines in BlueCore.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="code">The Code</a></h2>
    <h3><a name="button"><code>part4_buttons.button</code></a></h3>
    <p>
      The button functionality is defined in the <code>part4_buttons.button</code>
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the button file is similar to that in part 3, but now raw PIO
      handling is added. The basic messages are still there to demonstrate the
      ability of having both raw PIO messages and automatically generated
      button messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to PIO lines be named, lines must also be named but now as a raw input. 
Raw input lines are reported to the button task
      as if there was no button handler present. Raw PIOs are defined
      using
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px"><code><b>pio_raw</b> pin</code></p>
    <p>
      where <code>pin</code> is the PIO pin number between 0 and 31.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 40: 
 43 // Select PIOs 2 and 3 to generate raw messages on every change
 44 pio_raw 2
 45 pio_raw 3
 46 </pre></td></tr></table>

    <h3><a name="main"><code>main.c</code></a></h3>
    <p>
      The raw PIO handling must be done manually in the main application, just
      as in part 1. The buttons are defined first and then handled by a separate function 
<code>handle_pio_raw()</code>. The PIO
      example PIO handler here looks for the magic key pattern, but is not
      covered in the tutorial.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 
 21: /* Function prototypes */
 22: static void app_handler(Task task, MessageId id, Message message);
 23:+static void handle_pio_raw(Task task, PIO_RAW_T *raw);
 24: </pre></td></tr></table>
    <p>
      When a raw PIO event is detected, a <code>PIO_RAW</code> message is sent to
      the application task. The current state of the raw PIO pins are reported as
      a payload of the <code>PIO_RAW</code> message. The payload data is defined in
      the automatically generated header file <code>part4_buttons.h</code>.
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><pre> 26: 
 43: typedef struct
 44: {
 45: 	uint16 pio;
 46: } PIO_RAW_T;
 47: </pre></td></tr></table>

    <h2><a name="test">Testing the Application</a></h2>
    <p>
      This application is similar to that in part 3 except for the addition of 
      raw PIO handling. PIOs 0 and 1 (Buttons A and B respectively) are handled 
as buttons and PIOs 2 and 3 are handled as raw PIOs. Messages are sent when either
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both buttons A and B have been pressed down for a second,</li>
      <li>Button A has been pressed at least 3 seconds and is then released,
      </li>
      <li>Button B has been pressed down for a second, or kept pressed down
        for a second since the last message, or</li>
      <li>raw PIO state changes
    </ul>

    <p>
      To trigger the extra PIO handling code activate PIOs 2 and 3. The magic
      key sequence mentioned earlier is
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Release both PIOs 2 and 3</li>
      <li>Press (and keep pressed) PIO 2</li>
      <li>Press (and keep pressed) PIO 3</li>
      <li>Release PIO 2, and finally</li>
      <li>Press PIO 2 again</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="go_on">Further Tasks</a></h2>
    <p>
      This tutorial has presented basic simple tasks to do with BlueCore PIO
      lines, either directly, using generated button messages or both
      simultaneously. However, this is just an insight into PIO handling - the VM and Native Reference Guide
      contains a whole section on dealing with PIO lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>.button</code> files are parsed by <code>buttonparsepro.exe</code>
      which is located in the <code>[SDK installation]/tools/bin</code> directory. If run
      without parameters <code>buttonparsepro.exe</code> prints out usage
      information and outputs a sample <code>.button</code> file describing all
      supported features.
