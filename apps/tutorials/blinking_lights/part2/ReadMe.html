    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This tutorial briefly covers LED specific PIO functionality that is only available on certain BlueCore variants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The recommended hardware for this tutorial is a CaSiRA endpoint device with BlueCore5 MultiMedia module which has two dedicated LEDs (Red and Green).
        This will also work on the DEV-PC-1645B BlueCore BlueTunes2 development board which incorporates a BlueCore5 Multimedia with dedicated Red and Blue LEDs.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
        BlueCore solutions that have dedicated LED output have specific functionality for controlling these in the PIO API.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>LED_ENABLE</code> key with value <code>1</code> enables the LED.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>LED_DUTY_CYCLE()</code> key with value <code>0x7FF</code> selects a 50% duty cycle over the PWM period.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>LED_PERIOD()</code> key with value <code>0x1</code> selects the shortest PWM period to minimise noticeable flickering.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>LED_FLASH_ENABLE()</code> key with value <code>1</code> flashes or pulses the LED.
    </p>
    <p>        
        The <code>LED_FLASH_RATE()</code> key specifies the frequency at which to flash the LED.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application in this tutorial cause LED 0 and 1 to 'pulse' rather than flash. Both will fade up and down in intensity rather than just switch on and off. 
        LED 1 will pulse with more frequency than LED 0. Choosing a short PWM period relative to a flash frequency will reduce aliasing effects.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    This tutorial demonstrates the dedicated LED PIO control API available on certain BlueCore Variants allowing more effects then just toggling
    the LED on and off.
