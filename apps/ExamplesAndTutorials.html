    <h1>CSR Bluetooth SDK Examples and Tutorials</h1>

    <hr>

    
    <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>

      CSR's Bluetooth SDKs include a set of working examples and tutorials that demonstrate CSR's BlueCore functionality as well as 
	  providing clear guidance and best practice on how to develop applications for the BlueCore Virtual Machine and Kalimba DSP 
	  embedded environments.
	
    </p>
	
	<p>
	  
      These examples and tutorials cover both Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth features and functionality. As such, some examples require 
      a peer device with which to exchange data, some require CSR BlueCore development boards with specific hardware support, whilst some 
      require hardware such as sensors provided by 3rd-party manufacturers.  Use of 3rd party hardware will require the developer to add the 
      appropriate support in software.
    
    </p>

    <p>
    
      We recommend you read the SDK Support Documentation included in this release and also the relevant Bluetooth Technical Specifications.
    
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Tutorials">Tutorials</a></h2>

    <p>

      The tutorials are designed for developers new to the BlueCore development environment and include:

    <ul>

      <li>Internal Message Handling</li>

      <li>Button Handling</li>

      <li>Driving LEDs</li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h2>

    <p>

      The examples try to focus on selected features and are not intended to exhaustively cover the full list of functionality provided by the BlueCore libraries, 
      firmware and tools that are included in the SDK.  Several examples utilise the Kalimba DSP as found in the BlueCore MultiMedia ICs.
       The examples include:

    </p>

      <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - client & server</li>

    </ul>
    
    </p>
    
    <p>

    <b>Core Bluetooth Technology:</b>
    
    <ul>

      <li>Asynchronous ConnectionLess (ACL) Link Connection Status</li>

      <li>(Enhanced) Synchronous Connection Oriented (eSCO) Link - master & slave</li>

      <li>L2CAP connection, Secure Simple Pairing ('Just Works' model) - role A & B</li>

      <li>RFCOMM connection, searching using SDP records and Secure Simple Pairing ('Just Works' model) - role A & B</li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>

    <b>BlueCore Features:</b>
    
    <ul>

      <li>I<sup>2</sup>C Display</li>

      <li>LEDs & Buttons</li>

      <li>USB Audio</li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
    
    <b>DSP Examples:</b>

    <ul>

      <li>Tone Generator</li>

      <li>Rotary Encoder</li>

      <li>Accessing the Flash Memory from the DSP</li>

      <li>Accessing PS Keys and Long Messages between DSP and VM</li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>

      Each example consists of one xIDE Workspace (or two where peer devices are required), source and configuration files. 

    </p>
    
    <p>
    
    In some cases, an additional application is provided to run on the Windows host. 

    </p>

    <p>

        Please see the ReadMe file included in each workspace for specific details.
